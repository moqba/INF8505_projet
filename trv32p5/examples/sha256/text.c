"The United States of America has adopted a suite of Secure Hash Algorithms (SHAs), including four beyond SHA-1, as part of a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), specifically SHA-224 (RFC 3874), SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The purpose of this document is to make source code performing these hash functions conveniently available to the Internet community.  The sample code supports input strings of arbitrary bit length.  SHA-1's sample code from RFC 3174 has also been updated to handle input strings of arbitrary bit length.  Most of the text herein was adapted by the authors from FIPS 180-2.  Code to perform SHA-based HMACs, with arbitrary bit length text, is also included.  NOTE: Much of the text below is taken from [FIPS180-2] and assertions therein of the security of the algorithms described are made by the US Government, the author of [FIPS180-2], and not by the authors of this document.  The text below specifies Secure Hash Algorithms, SHA-224 [RFC3874], SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, for computing a condensed representation of a message or a data file. (SHA-1 is specified in [RFC3174].)  When a message of any length < 2^64 bits (for SHA-224 and SHA-256) or < 2^128 bits (for SHA-384 and SHA-512) is input to one of these algorithms, the result is an output called a message digest.  The message digests range in length from 224 to 512 bits, depending on the algorithm.  Secure hash algorithms are typically used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed hash authentication codes, or in the generation of random numbers [RFC4086].  The four algorithms specified in this document are called secure because it is computationally infeasible to (1) find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or (2) find two different messages that produce the same message digest.  Any change to a message in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest.  This will result in a verification failure when the secure hash algorithm is used with a digital signature algorithm or a keyed-hash message authentication algorithm.  The code provided herein supports input strings of arbitrary bit length.  SHA-1's sample code from [RFC3174] has also been updated to handle input strings of arbitrary bit length.  See Section 1.1 for license information for this code.  Section 2 below defines the terminology and functions used as building blocks to form these algorithms.  Section 3 describes the fundamental operations on words from which these algorithms are built.  Section 4 describes how messages are padded up to an integral multiple of the required block size and then parsed into blocks.  Section 5 defines the constants and the composite functions used to specify these algorithms.  Section 6 gives the actual specification for the SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 functions.  Section 7 provides pointers to the specification of HMAC keyed message authentication codes based on the SHA algorithms.  Section 8 gives sample code for the SHA algorithms and Section 9 code for SHA-based HMACs.  The SHA-based HMACs will accept arbitrary bit length text.";
