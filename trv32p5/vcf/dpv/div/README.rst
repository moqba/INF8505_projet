Data Path Validation for the Trv32p5 Sequential Divider
=======================================================

This directory contains formal proofs using Synopsys VC Static Data Path
Validation (DPV) technology, which is a transaction equivalence checker.

The contained example shows how to proof that the Verilog implementation of the
sequential divider unit implements unsigned division.
